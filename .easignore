# EAS Build ignore file
# Files and directories listed here will be excluded from the build archive
# This is similar to .gitignore but specific to EAS Build

# Exclude build artifacts
android/build/
android/.gradle/
android/app/build/
android/app/.cxx/
android/local.properties

# Exclude IDE files
android/.idea/
android/*.iml

# Exclude other generated files
android/.cxx/
android/*.hprof

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT exclude gradlew files - they are required for builds
# EAS Build will automatically include them even if they're in .gitignore
